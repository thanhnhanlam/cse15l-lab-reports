### Finding the Tests with Different Results

I used `vimdiff` on the results of running a bash for loop to compare the output of the different implementations.

![Vimdiff][Vimdiff]

###### Link to the test-files with different results

#### Test #1

Which implementation is correct (or neither)?

![Expected Output Test 1][Expected Output 1]

![My Implementation's Output Test 1][My Output 1]

![Provided Implementations's Output 1][Provided Output 1]

#### Test #2

Which implementation is correct (or neither)?

![ExpectedOutput Test 2][Expected Output 2]

![My Implementation's Output Test 1][My Output 1]

![Provided Implentation's Output 2][Provided Output 2]
